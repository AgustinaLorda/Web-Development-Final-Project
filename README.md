This project highlights a responsive personal portfolio website designed to showcase my skills, experience, and projects as a computer science student and web developer. Developed in collaboration with Adeoluwa Afolabi, the design emphasizes interactivity and usability, featuring a clean layout with dynamic elements like a dark mode toggle, hover effects, and a responsive timeline. The "Projects" section includes detailed descriptions of my work, categorized for easy navigation, while the "Skills" and "Experience" sections effectively showcase my expertise through clear visuals and detailed descriptions. The site is built with semantic HTML, styled with CSS variables for easy theme customization, and enhanced with JavaScript to implement interactive features, ensuring a cohesive and professional aesthetic.
